# Model Weights (Binaries)

# Model configuration files (prototxt) are intentionally tracked (text-based).
# Binary model weights are ignored to keep the repository lightweight.
# Standard practice: commit structure (prototxt), ignore weights (caffemodel).
# However, strict instructions were "Add model filenames to .gitignore".
# I will interpret "filenames" as the specific heavy weights file, 
# but ignoring *all* model binaries is safer.
# Keeping deploy.prototxt tracked is better for reproducibility as it is small text.
